With the Royalist Army losing such a vital facility and a number of valuable military assets at the hands of a single commando unit, neighboring countries like Esmia have been emboldened to provide more support to the Parliamentarian faction. And whilst the Royalist Army desperately lunges out to find the culprits of the attack, the Parliamentarians can now begin to put the finishing touches to their true plan; the rumored counter offensive that will bring this war to a just end!";
